# scikit-fairness
this repo might get accepted

This repo is being filled. Hopefully it becomes scikit-fairness some day.

## Goals 

Typically a machine learning pipeline might look something like this; 

```
data -> preprocess -> model -> postprocess -> metrics
```

The goal of this package is to introduce parts for all five of these
steps in order to make the entire pipeline more fair in production.
